                <h1>What is Cryptocurrency?</h1>
                <p>The most straightforward answer to the question, what is a cryptocurrency, is the phrase virtual
                    money. Each virtual currency is built on blockchain technology. Digital currency Bitcoin, like other
                    cryptocurrencies, is used to pay bills or transactions. But at the same time, digital money does not
                    have a central governing body. All operations are checked by the Blockchain network, i.e., by other
                    users. Each block consists of chain operations. They are all interconnected. Therefore, it is
                    impossible to fake or cancels a deal.</p>

                <h1>The Emergence of Cryptocurrency</h1>
                <p>In recent years, cryptocurrency—and in particular, Bitcoin—has demonstrated its value, now boasting
                    14 million Bitcoins in circulation. Investors speculating in the future possibilities of this new
                    technology have driven most of the current market capitalization, and this is likely to remain the
                    case until a certain measure of price stability and market acceptance is achieved. Apart from the
                    declared price of cryptocurrency, those invested in it appear to be relying on a perceived “inherent
                    value” of cryptocurrency. This includes the technology and network itself, the integrity of the
                    cryptographic code and the decentralized network.</p>

                <h1>Different types of Cryptocurrencies</h1>
                <p>When Bitcoin launched in 2009, it didn’t have much — or any — competition in the newly minted realm
                    of digital currency. By 2011, though, new types of cryptocurrency began to emerge as competitors
                    adopted the blockchain technology bitcoin was built on to launch their own platforms and currencies.
                    Suddenly the race to create more crypto was on.

                    Today there are thousands of different types of cryptocurrency, and while each is designed to
                    provide some new feature or function, most are founded on similar principles to those that
                    established bitcoin:</p>

                <h1>How to buy Cryptocurrency?</h1>
                <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that trade on a 24/7 global market. If you're thinking about
                    adding cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, or dogecoin to your investment portfolio, you have
                    several options for doing so.
                    "Cryptocurrency is a unit of measure. It is a digital token that can be transferred from one party
                    to another, but not duplicated," explains Charles Allen, chief executive officer of BTCS, Inc.
                    Unlike physical fiat currencies (e.g., the US Dollar), cryptocurrencies are decentralized, virtual
                    currencies that are typically used to purchase goods or services. These assets utilize blockchain
                    technology to ensure that transactions between each party are secure.</p>
